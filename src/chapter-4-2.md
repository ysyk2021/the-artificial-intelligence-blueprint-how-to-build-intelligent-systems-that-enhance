Introduction
------------

In this chapter, we will explore the critical process of identifying data sources and understanding data needs when building intelligent systems that enhance business performance using artificial intelligence (AI). Data is the core fuel for AI models and algorithms, and having a comprehensive understanding of data sources, quality, and relevance is crucial for successful AI implementation. We will discuss key considerations, strategies, and best practices for identifying data sources and determining data requirements to drive effective AI projects.
